# Exercises from chapter 5

>
> 5. (a) Write a menu-driven program that provides three options:
>
> - the first option allows the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and displays
> the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature;
>
> -the second option allows the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit and
> displays the corresponding Celsius temperature;
>
> - the third option allows the user to quit.
>
> The formulae that you need are as follows, where C represents a Celsius tem-
> perature and F a Fahrenheit temperature:
>
> F = (9C/5) + 32
>
> C = (5(F-32))/9
>
> (b) Adapt the above program so that the user is not allowed to enter a tem-
> perature below absolute zero; this is −273.15C, or −459.67F.


# Program execution

E.g.

```bash
java CelsiusToFahrenheit.java
```
