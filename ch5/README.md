# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Exercises from chapter 5 - Methods

> 5.10 Programming Exercises
>
> 1. Implement the programs from the self-test questions in order to verify your
> answers.
>
> 2. For one of the programming exercises in Chap. 2, you wrote a program that
> converted pounds to kilograms. Rewrite this program, so that the conversion
> takes place in a separate method which is called by the main method.
>
> 3. In the exercises at the end of Chap. 2 you were asked to write a program that
> calculated the area and perimeter of a rectangle. Re-write this program so that
> now the instructions for calculating the area and perimeter of the rectangle are
> contained in two separate methods.
>
> 4. (a) Design and implement a program that converts a sum of money to a different
> currency. The amount of money to be converted, and the exchange rate, are
> entered by the user. The program should have separate methods for:
>
> - obtaining the sum of money from the user;
> - obtaining the exchange rate from the user;
> - making the conversion;
> - displaying the result.
>
> (b) Adapt the above program so that after the result is displayed the user is asked
> if he or she wishes to convert another sum of money. The program continues
> in this way until the user chooses to quit.
>
> 5. (a) Write a menu-driven program that provides three options:
>
> - the first option allows the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and displays
> the corresponding Fahrenheit temperature;
>
> - the second option allows the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit and
> displays the corresponding Celsius temperature;
>
> - the third option allows the user to quit.
>
> The formulae that you need are as follows, where C represents a Celsius temperature
> and F a Fahrenheit temperature:
>
> F = (9C/5) + 32
>
> C = (5(F-32))/9
>
> (b) Adapt the above program so that the user is not allowed to enter a tem-
> perature below absolute zero; this is −273.15C, or −459.67F.
