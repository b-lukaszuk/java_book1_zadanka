# Exercises from chapter 5 - Methods

>
> 4. (a) Design and implement a program that converts a sum of money to a different
> currency. The amount of money to be converted, and the exchange rate, are
> entered by the user. The program should have separate methods for:
>
> - obtaining the sum of money from the user;
> - obtaining the exchange rate from the user;
> - making the conversion;
> - displaying the result.
>
> (b) Adapt the above program so that after the result is displayed the user is asked
> if he or she wishes to convert another sum of money. The program continues
> in this way until the user chooses to quit.


# Program execution

E.g.

```bash
java MoneyExchangeCalculator.java
