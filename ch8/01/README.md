# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

**Programming exercises from chapter 8 - Implementing Classes**

Here I'm gonna put the text from the book without the block quote (for better readibility)

# Task 1

## Task 1a

Implement the CircularShape class that was discussed in self-test question 1 above.

## Task 1b

Add the calculateDiameter method (calculates diameter of the circle) into this class as discussed in self-test question 1d and 1e above.

## Task 1c

Write a program to test out your class. This program should allow the user to enter a value for the radius of the circle, and then display the area, circumference and diameter of this circle on the screen by calling the appropriate methods of the CircularShape class.

## Task 1d

Modify the tester program above so that once the information has been displayed the user is able to reset the radius of the circle. The area, circumference and diameter of the circle should then be displayed again.
