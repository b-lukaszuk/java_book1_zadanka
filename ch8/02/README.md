# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

**Programming exercises from chapter 8 - Implementing Classes**

Here I'm gonna put the text from the book without the block quote (for better readibility)

# Task 2

## Task 2a

Write the code for the Student class discussed in self-test question 2 above.

Reminder:

<pre>
|---------------------------------|
|                                 |
| Student                         |
|                                 |
|---------------------------------|
|                                 |
| -studentNumber: String          |
| -studentName: String            |
| -markForMaths: int              |
| -markForEnglish: int            |
| -markForScience: int            |
| -fee: doublle                   |
|                                 |
|---------------------------------|
|                                 |
| +Student(String, String)        |
| +getNumber(): String            |
| +getName(): String              |
| +enterMarks(int, int, int)      |
| +getMathsMark(): int            |
| +getEnglishMark(): int          |
| +getScienceMark(): int          |
| +calculateAverageMark(): double |
| +getFee(): double               |
| +setFee(double)                 |
|                                 |
|---------------------------------|
</pre>

You should note that in order to ensure that a double is returned from the calculateAverageMark method you should specifically divide the total of the three marks by 3.0 and not simply by 3 (look back at Chap. 2 to remind yourself why this is the case).

Another thing to think about is what you choose for the initial values of the marks. If you chose to give each mark an initial value of zero, this could be ambiguous; a mark of zero could mean that the mark simply has not been enteredâ€”or it could mean the student actually scored zero in the subject! Can you think of a better initial value?

You can assume that the fees for the student are set initially to 3000.

## Task 2b

Write a tester class to test out your Student class; it should create two or three students (or even better an ArrayList of students), and use the methods of the Student class to test whether they work according to the specification.

# Program execution

```bash
java Main.java
