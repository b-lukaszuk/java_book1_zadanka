# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Programming exercises from chapter 6 - Arrays

> 1. Implement the program TemperatureReadings3 from Sect. 6.6, which
> read in and displayed a series of temperature readings for a given week. Now
>
> (a) implement the wasHot method that you designed in self-test question 3
> above;
>
> (b) add a final instruction into the main method that calls this wasHot
> method.
