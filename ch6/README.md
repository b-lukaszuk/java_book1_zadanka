# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Programming exercises from chapter 6 - Arrays

> 1. Implement the program TemperatureReadings3 from Sect. 6.6, which
> read in and displayed a series of temperature readings for a given week. Now
>
> (a) implement the wasHot method that you designed in self-test question 3
> above;
>
> (b) add a final instruction into the main method that calls this wasHot
> method.
>
> 2. Implement the program SomeUsefulArrayMethods from Sect. 6.8.5,
> which manipulates an array of integers, then
>
> (a) re-write the contains method using varargs syntax as discussed in self
> test question 5 above;
>
> (b) add an additional method to return the average from the array of integers
> (make use of the sum method to help you calculate the average);
>
> (c) add one more method to display on the screen all those values greater than
> or equal to the average.
>
> 3. Implement a program for entering and displaying student scores that tests your
> answers to self-test question 4 above.
>
> 4. Implement the MonthlyTemperatures program from Sect. 6.9.4, which
> read in and displayed temperature readings for four weeks of a month. Now
>
> (a) implement the max method that you designed in self-test question 8 above;
>
> (b) add a final instruction into the main method that calls this max method.
>
> 5. Design and implement a magic word square program that allows you to test your
> answers to self-test question 10 above. The program should initialize the word
> square given in the question and then use the methods displayRow and
> displayColumn to display all the words in the magic word square.
>
> 6. Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter into an array the
> price of 5 products in pounds sterling. The program should then copy this array
> into another array but convert the price of each product from pounds sterling to
> US dollars. The program should allow the user to enter the exchange rate of
> pounds to dollars, and should, when it terminates, display the contents of both
> arrays. Once again, make use of methods in your program to carry out these
> tasks.
>
> 7. Amend the program in Exercise 6 above so that
>
> (a) the user is asked how many items they wish to purchase and the arrays are
> then sized accordingly;
>
> (b) the total cost of the order is displayed in both currencies.
>
> 8. Design and implement a program that allows you to test your answers to
> self-test question 11 above. The program should allow the user to enter numbers
> into the ragged triangle array and then find the largest number in the array as
> discussed in the question.
