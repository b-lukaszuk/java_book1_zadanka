# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Programming exercises from chapter 6 - Arrays

> 6. Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter into an array the
> price of 5 products in pounds sterling. The program should then copy this array
> into another array but convert the price of each product from pounds sterling to
> US dollars. The program should allow the user to enter the exchange rate of
> pounds to dollars, and should, when it terminates, display the contents of both
> arrays. Once again, make use of methods in your program to carry out these
> tasks.

# Running program

E.g.

```bash
java PricesConverter.java
```
