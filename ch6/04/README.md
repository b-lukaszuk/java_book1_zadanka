# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Programming exercises from chapter 6 - Arrays

> 4. Implement the MonthlyTemperatures program from Sect. 6.9.4, which
> read in and displayed temperature readings for four weeks of a month. Now
>
> (a) implement the max method that you designed in self-test question 8 above;
>
> (b) add a final instruction into the main method that calls this max method.

# Running program

E.g.

```bash
java MontlhyTemperatures.java
```
