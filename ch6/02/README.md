# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Programming exercises from chapter 6 - Arrays

> 2. Implement the program SomeUsefulArrayMethods from Sect. 6.8.5,
> which manipulates an array of integers, then
>
> (a) re-write the contains method using varargs syntax as discussed in self
> test question 5 above;
>
> (b) add an additional method to return the average from the array of integers
> (make use of the sum method to help you calculate the average);
>
> (c) add one more method to display on the screen all those values greater than
> or equal to the average.
