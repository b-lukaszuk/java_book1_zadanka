# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Programming exercises from chapter 6 - Arrays

> 7. Amend the program in Exercise 6 above so that
>
> (a) the user is asked how many items they wish to purchase and the arrays are
> then sized accordingly;
>
> (b) the total cost of the order is displayed in both currencies.
