# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Programming exercises from chapter 7 - Classes and Objects

> In order to tackle these exercises make sure that the classes Oblong, Bank-
> Account and EasyScanner have been copied from the website and placed in
> the correct directory for your compiler to access them.


> 3. Adapt the StringComparison program from Sect. 7.6.3, which compares

> two strings, in the following ways:
>
> a. Rewrite the program so that it ignores case;
>
> b. Rewrite the program, using the equals method, so that all it does is to test
> whether the two strings are the same;
>
> c. Repeat (b) using the equalsIgnoreCase method;
>
> d. Use the trim method so that the program ignores leading or trailing spaces.

# Running program

E.g.

```bash
java StringComparison.java
```

Three versions of the program to choose:

- `StringComparison.java` - version from the book
- `StringComparison1.java` - solution to a.
- `StringComparison2.java` - solution to b.
- `StringComparison3.java` - soution to c.
- `StringComparison4.java` - solution to d.
