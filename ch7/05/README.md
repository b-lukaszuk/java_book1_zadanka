# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Programming exercises from chapter 7 - Classes and Objects

> In order to tackle these exercises make sure that the classes Oblong, Bank-
> Account and EasyScanner have been copied from the website and placed in
> the correct directory for your compiler to access them.

> 5. Write a program that creates an array of Oblong objects to represent the
> dimensions of rooms in an apartment as described in self test question 6. The
> program should allow the user to:
>
> * Determine the number of rooms;
> * Enter the dimensions of the rooms;
> * Retrieve the area and dimensions of any of the rooms.

# Running program

E.g.

```bash
java Rooms.java
```
