# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Programming exercises from chapter 7 - Classes and Objects

> In order to tackle these exercises make sure that the classes Oblong, Bank-
> Account and EasyScanner have been copied from the website and placed in
> the correct directory for your compiler to access them.

> 2. Consider a program to enter and confirm a suitable code name for an agent.
> Declare two string objects, called codeName and confirm and then
>
> a. Prompt to get the user to enter a suitable name into the codeName string;
>
> b. Use a while loop to ensure that the string entered is greater than 6 char-
> acters in length, if it is not print “INVALID CODENAME” and ask the user
> to re-enter a code name;
>
> c. Once a valid code name has been entered ask the user to re-enter the code
> name into the confirm string and then use an if else statement to ensure
> that the string entered matches the original code name; if it does, print a
> message “CODE NAME CONFIRMED” otherwise print a message saying
> “CODE NAME MIS-MATCH”;
>
> d. Use the charAt method to ensure that the code name ends with an ‘X’
> character;
>
> e. Finally use the startsWith method to ensure that, as well as being
> greater than 6 characters in length, the code name entered also starts with the
> words “Agent”.

# Running program

E.g.

```bash
java Agent.java
```
