# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

# Programming exercises from chapter 7 - Classes and Objects

> In order to tackle these exercises make sure that the classes Oblong, Bank-
> Account and EasyScanner have been copied from the website and placed in
> the correct directory for your compiler to access them.

> 4. Design and implement a program that performs in the following way:
>
> * When the program starts, two bank accounts are created, using names and
> numbers which are written into the code;
>
> * The user is then asked to enter an account number, followed by an amount to
> deposit in that account;
>
> * The balance of the appropriate account is then updated accordinglyâ€”or if an
> incorrect account number was entered a message to this effect is displayed;
>
> * The user is then asked if he or she wishes to make more deposits;
>
> * If the user answers does wish to make more deposits, the process continues;
>
> * If the user does not wish to make more deposits, then details of both accounts
> (account number, account name and balance) are displayed.

# Running program

E.g.

```bash
java BankAccountsManager.java
```
