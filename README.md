# Java - programming exercises

# Info

I'm solving programming exercises that are placed at the end of each chapter in:
"Java in Two Semesters. Fourth edition" by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans

Starting from Chapter 5 (other chapters' exercises were too easy)

Update from 02-04-2021, i.e. while reading `Chapter 8. Implementing Classes`, there gonna be more proper classes and code organization (before I did it based on instinct)

# Uzywane IDE

So far none.
For now I use Emacs (without specific configuration for Java) and openjdk 11.0.10, with time I will most likely install lsp-mode and lsp-java (or something alike).

Update (29-03-2021).
I added lsp-mode and lsp-java to my Emacs configuration.
